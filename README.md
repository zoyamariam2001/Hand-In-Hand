The project is a website that I had to create for an NGO during an internship that I did.

The site tells the viewers about the NGO, the services offered by it, ways to contact the team and how to donate to them.

RazorPay has been integrated to carry out the payment.

I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, SQL, PHP in the project.

The website is hosted on 000webhost.

The link to the website is:    https://hand-in-hand-ngo.000webhostapp.com/
